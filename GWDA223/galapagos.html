        <h1 class="headline">About Galapagos Islands</h1>
        <p>Galápagos Islands (Official name: Archipiélago de Colón) are an
        archipelago of volcanic islands distributed around the equator in the
        Pacific Ocean, 972 km west of continental Ecuador. It is a UNESCO World
        Heritage site: wildlife is its most notable feature.</p>
        <p>The Galápagos Islands form the Galápagos Province of Ecuador and are
        part of the country's national park system. The principal language on the
        islands is Spanish. The islands have a population of around 40,000, which
        is a 40-fold expansion in 50 years.</p>
        <p>The islands are geologically young and famed for their vast number of
        endemic species, which were studied by Charles Darwin during the voyage
        of the Beagle. His observations and collections contributed to the inception
        of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection.</p>

        <h1 class="headline">Geography</h1>
        <p>The Galápagos Islands are located in the eastern Pacific Ocean at
        973 km (604 miles) off the west coast of South America. The closest land
        mass is the mainland of Ecuador to the east (the country to which they belong),
        to the North is Cocos Island 720 km (447 miles) and to the South is
        Easter Island and San Felix Island at 3200 km (1,990 miles).</p>
        <p>The islands are found at the coordinates 1°40'N-1°36'S, 89°16'-92°01'W.
        Straddling the equator, islands in the chain are located in both the northern
        and southern hemisphere with Volcan Wolf and Volcano Ecuador on Island Isabela
        being directly on the equator line. Española the southernmost island and Darwin
        the northernmost island is spread out over a distance of 220 km (137 miles).</p>
        <p>The Galapagos Archipelago consists of 7,880 square km (3,042 sq. miles)
        of land spread over 45,000 square km (28,000 miles) of ocean. The largest
        of the islands, Isabela, measures 4,640 square km and making up half of
        the total land area of the Galapagos. Volcan Wolf, on Isabela is the highest
        point with an elevation of 1,707 m (5,600 ft.) above sea level.</p>
        <p>The group consists of 13 main islands, 6 smaller islands, and 107 rocks
        and islets. The islands are located at the Galapagos Triple Junction. It
        is also atop the Galapagos hotspot, a place where the Earth's crust is
        being melted from below by a mantle plume, creating volcanoes. The oldest
        island is thought to have formed between 5 and 10 million years ago. The
        youngest islands, Isabela and Fernandina, are still being formed, with the
        most recent volcanic eruption in May 2008 when the 1,690-meter-high (5,541 feet)
        Cerro Azul mountain started spewing lava after 10 years of inactivity on
        the island of Isabela.</p>

      <div class="article3 copy" id="weather">
        <h1 class="headline">Weather</h1>
        <p>Although located on the Equator, the Humboldt Current brings cold water
        to the islands, causing frequent drizzles during most of the year. The
        weather is periodically influenced by the El Niño phenomenon which brings
        warmer temperatures and heavy rains.</p>
        <p>During the season known as the "Garua" (June to November) the temperature
        by the sea is 22°C, a steady and cold wind blows from South and Southeast,
        and frequent drizzles (Garuas) last most of the day, along with dense fog
        which conceals the islands. During the warm season (December to May) the
        average sea and air temperature rises to 25°C, there is no wind at all,
        there are sporadic though strong rains and the sun shines.</p>
        <p>Weather changes as altitude increases in the large islands. Temperature
        decreases gradually with altitude, while precipitation increases due to
        the condensation of moisture in clouds on the slopes. There is a large
        variation in precipitation from one place to another, not only with altitude
        but also depending on the location of the islands, and also with the seasons.</p>

        <h1 class="headline">Wildlife</h1>
        <h2 class="headline2">Fauna</h2>
        <p>One of the best known is the Galápagos tortoise, which lives on seven
        of the islands. It has an average lifespan of more than 150 years.</p>
        <p>The Marine Iguana is also extremely unusual, since it is the only iguana
        adapted to life in the water. Land iguanas, lava lizards, geckos and other
        harmless snakes can also be found in the Islands. The large number and
        range of birds is also of interest to scientists and tourists. Around 56
        varieties live in the archipelago, of which 27 are found only in the Galápagos.
        Some of these are found only on one island.</p>
        <p>The most outstanding are penguins, which live on the colder coasts,
        Darwin's finches, frigate birds, albatrosses, gulls, boobies, pelicans
        and Galápagos Hawks, among others. The Flightless Cormorant, a peculiar
        bird which has lost the ability to fly, is also part of this rich fauna.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, there are few mammal species, mostly sea mammals
        such as whales, dolphins and sea lions. A few species of endemic Galapagos
        mice (or Rice rats) - the Santiago Galapagos Mouse and the Fernandina Galapagos
        Mouse - have been recently rediscovered.</p>
        <h2 class="headline2">Flora</h2>
        <p>On the larger Galápagos Islands, four ecological zones nave been defined:
        coastal, low or dry, transitional and humid. In the first, species such as
        myrtle, mangrove and saltbush can be found. In the second grow cactus,
        the incensé tree, carob tree, poison apple tree, chala and yellow cordia,
        among others. In the transitional zone taller trees, epiphytes and perennial
        herbs can be seen. The best known varieties are the cat's claw, espuela de gallo.
        In the humid sector are the cogojo, Galápagos guava, cat's claw, Galapagos coffee,
        passionflower and some types of moss, ferns and fungus.</p>
